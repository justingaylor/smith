# Smith: Open-source framework for rapid creation of AI agents

## Overview

I'm honestly not sure yet what Smith should be. I'll fill this out as soon as
I know more.

By the way, I named it Smith after the character Agent Smith in the Matrix.
I also intend for this framework to function as a smithy for quickly creating
AI agents.

In the meantime, here are some nice quotes.
